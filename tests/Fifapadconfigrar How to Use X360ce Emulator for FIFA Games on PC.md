How does Fifapadconfigrar work? Fifapadconfigrar is a compressed file that contains an executable file and a configuration file. The executable file is the program that lets you adjust your gamepad settings. The configuration file is the file that stores your gamepad settings. When you run the program, it will read the configuration file and show you the current settings of your gamepad. You can then modify them as you wish and save the changes. The program will then update the configuration file with the new settings.
 
Once you have done that, you need to copy the configuration file to the same folder where your FIFA game is installed. This way, the FIFA game will read the configuration file and apply your gamepad settings. You can then launch your FIFA game and play with your gamepad as usual.
