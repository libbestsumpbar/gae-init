## Magic Lines 3.6: Tips and Tricks to Master the Game
 
Magic Lines 3.6 is a game that requires both strategy and luck. You have to think ahead and anticipate the moves of the balls, but you also have to deal with the randomness of their appearance. Here are some tips and tricks to help you master the game and score higher points.
 
- Plan your moves carefully. Don't just move the balls randomly, but try to create lines of the same color as much as possible. Look for potential lines in different directions and angles, and avoid blocking them with other balls.
- Use the undo button wisely. The game allows you to undo your last move, which can be very helpful if you make a mistake or change your mind. However, you can only use it once per turn, so don't waste it on trivial moves.
- Watch out for the next ball indicator. The game shows you the color of the next ball that will appear on the board, which can help you plan your moves accordingly. Try to create space for the next ball or use it to complete a line.
- Don't let the board fill up. The game ends when there are no more empty cells on the board, so try to keep some space open at all times. Clearing lines will free up some cells, but sometimes you might have to sacrifice some points to avoid losing the game.
- Try different difficulty levels. The game has four difficulty levels: easy, normal, hard, and expert. The higher the level, the more balls per turn are placed on the board, and the less time you have to make a move. Try different levels to challenge yourself and improve your skills.
- Have fun and enjoy the game. Magic Lines 3.6 is a game that can provide hours of entertainment and relaxation. Don't get frustrated if you lose or don't get a high score. Just enjoy the colorful graphics, the soothing music, and the engaging gameplay.

Magic Lines 3.6 is a game that will appeal to anyone who likes puzzles and logic games. It is easy to learn but hard to master, and it will keep you hooked for a long time. Download it today and see how many points you can score!
