# Oberheim SEM V: A Classic Synth Reimagined for the Modern Producer
 
Oberheim SEM V is a software emulation of the legendary Oberheim Synthesizer Expander Module (SEM), a monophonic analog synth that was created by Tom Oberheim in 1974. The SEM was known for its warm and fat sound, its versatile multi-mode filter, and its simple but powerful design. The SEM was used by many famous musicians, such as Jean-Michel Jarre, Tangerine Dream, Depeche Mode, and more.

## How to create sounds with Oberheim SEM V
 
Oberheim SEM V is capable of creating a wide range of sounds, from classic analog sounds to modern digital sounds. Here are some examples of how to create different types of sounds with Oberheim SEM V:
 
- **Bass sounds:** To create a deep and punchy bass sound, use a sawtooth waveform on both oscillators and detune them slightly. Set the filter mode to low-pass and lower the cutoff frequency until you get a smooth tone. Increase the resonance to add some bite and character. Use envelope 1 to modulate the filter cutoff with a short attack and decay, and a high sustain level. Use envelope 2 to modulate the amplitude with a short attack and decay, and a low sustain level. Add some drive to the output section to make it louder and warmer.
- **Lead sounds:** To create a vintage lead sound, use a pulse waveform on both oscillators and adjust the pulse width for each one. Set the filter mode to band-pass and increase the cutoff frequency until you get a bright tone. Decrease the resonance to make it smoother. Use envelope 1 to modulate the filter cutoff with a medium attack and decay, and a medium sustain level. Use envelope 2 to modulate the amplitude with a medium attack and decay, and a high sustain level. Add some portamento to make it glide between notes.
- **Pad sounds:** To create a rich and immersive pad sound, use different waveforms on each oscillator and detune them widely. Set the filter mode to notch and lower the cutoff frequency until you get a dark tone. Increase the resonance to add some movement and interest. Use envelope 1 to modulate the filter cutoff with a long attack and decay, and a low sustain level. Use envelope 2 to modulate the amplitude with a long attack and decay, and a high sustain level. Add some modulation from LFO 1 or LFO 2 to modulate the pitch or pulse width of the oscillators for some subtle variation. Add some delay and reverb effects to make it spacious.

These are just some basic examples of how to create sounds with Oberheim SEM V. You can experiment with different settings and parameters to create your own unique sounds. You can also browse through the presets that are included with Oberheim SEM V for more inspiration.
