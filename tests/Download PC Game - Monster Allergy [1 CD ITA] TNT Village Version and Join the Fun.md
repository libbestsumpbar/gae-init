If you are looking for some tips and tricks to improve your gameplay and master Monster Allergy, you have come to the right place. Here are some of the best advice we can give you to help you enjoy this game even more.

- Master the landing. Jumping up in the air and performing tricks is fun, but it won't help you much if you mess up your landing. You need to time your jumps well and adjust your angle and speed to land smoothly and avoid losing momentum or crashing. You can use the L and R buttons to tilt your character forward or backward while in the air, and the A button to brake when you land.
- Use your powers wisely. Zick and Elena have different powers that can help them in different situations. Zick can use his Dom Vision to see invisible monsters, his Energy Blast to attack enemies from a distance, and his Dom Box to capture monsters. Elena can use her Photographic Memory to remember clues and passwords, her Super Scream to stun enemies, and her Camera Flash to blind enemies. You can switch between Zick and Elena at any time by pressing the X button, and use their powers by pressing the Y button. However, be aware that using powers consumes energy, which can be replenished by collecting blue orbs or resting at checkpoints.
- Explore the levels. Monster Allergy has 25 levels that are based on locations from the comic book and the animated series, such as Zick's house, Bibbur-Si, Oldmill Village, and more. Each level has hidden secrets, collectibles, and bonus areas that you can discover by exploring every corner. You can find monster cards that give you information about each monster's history, personality, and powers. You can also find comic pages that unlock extra content in the gallery. Some levels also have mini-games that you can play for fun and rewards.

Monster Allergy is a game that will challenge your skills and test your knowledge of the Monster Allergy universe. It is a game that will keep you entertained for hours with its variety of gameplay, humor, and fun. We hope that these tips and tricks will help you enjoy this game even more.
