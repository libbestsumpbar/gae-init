But how can you download Battlefield 3 for PC for free? Well, there are two ways to do that. One is to use Origin, the online gaming platform by Electronic Arts. The other is to use Steam, the digital distribution service by Valve.
 
## Download Battlefield 3 for PC for Free via Origin
 
Origin is the official platform where you can buy and play Battlefield 3 for PC. However, sometimes Origin offers some games for free as part of its On the House program. This means that for a limited time, you can add the game to your library and keep it forever. You can then download and install it whenever you want.

According to Electronic Arts[^2^], Battlefield 3 was one of the games that was On the House in May 2014. This means that if you added the game to your library during that period, you can still download it for free today. However, if you missed that opportunity, you will have to wait until Origin offers Battlefield 3 for free again.
 
To check if Battlefield 3 is On the House, you need to visit the Origin website or open the Origin app on your PC. Then, go to the Store section and look for the On the House banner. If you see Battlefield 3 there, click on it and add it to your library. You will need an Origin account to do that. If you don't have one, you can create one for free.
 
Once you have added Battlefield 3 to your library, you can download it by going to your Game Library section and clicking on Download. You will need about 20 GB of free space on your hard drive to install the game.
 
## Download Battlefield 3 for PC for Free via Steam
 
Steam is another platform where you can buy and play Battlefield 3 for PC. However, unlike Origin, Steam does not offer Battlefield 3 for free as part of any program. This means that you will have to pay $39.99 to get the Premium Edition of the game[^1^], which includes all five expansion packs and some extra features.
 
However, there is a way to download Battlefield 3 for PC for free via Steam if you already own the game on Origin. This is because Steam allows you to add non-Steam games to your library and launch them from there. This way, you can enjoy some of the benefits of Steam, such as achievements, screenshots, and friends list.
 
To add Battlefield 3 to your Steam library, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Open Steam and log in with your account.
2. Go to the Library section and click on Add a Game at the bottom left corner.
3. Select Add a Non-Steam Game from the menu.
4. A new window will pop up with a list of programs on your PC. Look for Battlefield 3 or browse for it if it's not there.
5. Check the box next to Battlefield 3 and click on Add Selected Programs.
6. Battlefield 3 will appear in your Steam library under Non-Steam Games.
7. To launch it from Steam, just double-click on it or right-click and select Play Game.

Note that this method does not allow you to download Battlefield 3 from Steam. You still need to have it installed on your PC via Origin. Also, this method does not grant you access to any Steam features that require a valid Steam license, such as cloud saves or trading cards.
 
## Conclusion
 
Battlefield 3 is a great game that offers a lot of fun and action for PC gamers. However, if you want to download it for free, you will have to rely on Origin's On the House program
