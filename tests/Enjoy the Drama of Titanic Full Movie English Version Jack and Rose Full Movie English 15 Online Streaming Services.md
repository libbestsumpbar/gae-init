## The Cast
 
Titanic features a stellar cast of actors who bring the characters to life. The main protagonists are Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater, played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. DiCaprio and Winslet have a great chemistry on screen and deliver convincing performances as the star-crossed lovers. They also show a range of emotions, from joy and passion to fear and despair. DiCaprio and Winslet were both nominated for Oscars for their roles, but did not win.
 
The supporting cast is also impressive, with actors such as Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bill Paxton, and Victor Garber. They portray various characters who represent the different classes and perspectives on board the Titanic. Some of them are sympathetic and helpful, while others are antagonistic and selfish. They all add depth and realism to the story.
  
## The Script
 
Titanic was written and directed by James Cameron, who is known for his epic and visionary movies. Cameron spent years researching the history and details of the Titanic, and incorporated many real-life events and people into his script. He also created a fictional love story that serves as the emotional core of the movie. The script is well-written, with memorable dialogue, dramatic scenes, and emotional moments. The script also explores themes such as social class, destiny, sacrifice, and survival.
 
However, the script is not flawless. Some critics have pointed out that the script is too long, too predictable, too sentimental, or too clichÃ©d. Some have also argued that the script does not accurately portray the historical facts or the cultural context of the Titanic. For example, some have claimed that the script exaggerates the class differences, ignores the racial diversity, or downplays the role of women on board the Titanic.
