So, if you are curious about Six X movie 720p download movie, you can find it online on various websites and platforms. But be warned, this movie is not for everyone and might leave you unsatisfied and disgusted.
  
Despite its bold attempt to showcase the struggles and desires of women in a patriarchal society, Six X fails to impress the critics and the audience alike. The film has received mostly negative reviews for its lack of originality, coherence and sensitivity. The film has been accused of being a cheap imitation of other erotic anthologies such as Lust Stories and Bombay Talkies.
 
Some critics have also pointed out the film's problematic depiction of women and sexuality, which reinforces stereotypes and prejudices rather than challenging them. For instance, the film portrays homosexuality as a result of trauma, prostitution as a glamorous profession, and rape as a form of revenge. The film also objectifies and exploits its female actors, who are often seen in skimpy outfits and compromising positions.
 
Moreover, the film suffers from technical flaws such as poor sound design, choppy editing, inconsistent lighting and amateurish cinematography. The film also has a weak musical score, which fails to create any impact or emotion. The film's dialogues are often cheesy, clichÃƒÂ©d and unrealistic. The film's performances are also subpar, with some actors hamming it up and others looking bored and uncomfortable.
  
However, Six X is not without its merits. The film does have some moments of genuine emotion and insight, which show the potential of the film's premise and theme. The film also has some talented actors who manage to rise above the mediocre material and deliver convincing performances. For instance, Shweta Tiwari shines as a battered wife who finds solace in a younger man, and Rituparna Sengupta impresses as a successful businesswoman who faces a moral dilemma.
 
Furthermore, Six X is a rare film that dares to explore the taboo and controversial aspects of women's sexuality in India, where such topics are often suppressed or ignored. The film tries to give voice to the women who are often silenced or shamed by society for their choices and preferences. The film also tries to challenge the double standards and hypocrisy that exist in the Indian culture regarding sex and gender.
 
Therefore, Six X is a film that might appeal to some viewers who are looking for a different and daring kind of cinema. The film might also spark some discussions and debates about the issues it raises. However, the film is not for everyone, and might offend or bore many others. The film is a flawed and uneven attempt at making an erotic drama that is both entertaining and enlightening.
