## What is Nightshade Additional Scenarios Bundle?
 
Nightshade Additional Scenarios Bundle is a DLC pack that contains six extra stories for each of the five main love interests of Nightshade. These stories are divided into two categories: A1 and B1. The A1 scenarios are set after the good endings of the main game, and show how the relationship between the heroine and her chosen partner develops further. The B1 scenarios are set after the bad endings of the main game, and explore what could have happened if things had gone differently.
 
The additional scenarios bundle also includes new CGs, voice acting, music, and achievements. The total playtime of the bundle is estimated to be around 10 hours, depending on your reading speed and choices.
 
## Is it worth buying?
 
The answer to this question depends on how much you enjoyed Nightshade and its characters. If you loved the main game and want to see more of your favorite love interest, then you might find the additional scenarios bundle satisfying and rewarding. The A1 scenarios are sweet and romantic, while the B1 scenarios are dark and dramatic. Both types of scenarios add more depth and nuance to the characters and their relationships.
 
However, if you are looking for a completely new story or a different perspective, then you might be disappointed by the additional scenarios bundle. The bundle does not introduce any new characters or settings, and it does not change the main plot or outcome of Nightshade. The bundle is meant to be a supplement to the main game, not a replacement or a sequel.
 
The additional scenarios bundle is also relatively expensive compared to other otome game DLCs. The bundle costs $9.99 on Steam, which is almost half of the price of Nightshade itself ($19.99). Some players might find this price too high for the amount of content offered.
 
## Can you play it on a portable device?
 
The good news is that yes, you can play Nightshade Additional Scenarios Bundle on a portable device. The bad news is that you need to buy Nightshade again on a different platform.
 
Nightshade Additional Scenarios Bundle is only available on Steam for PC users. However, Nightshade itself is also available on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation Vita. If you buy Nightshade on either of these platforms, you will get the additional scenarios bundle included in the game. You do not need to buy it separately.
 
This means that if you want to play Nightshade Additional Scenarios Bundle on a portable device, you need to either buy Nightshade on Switch or Vita, or use a Steam Link app to stream Nightshade from your PC to your phone or tablet. Both options have their pros and cons, so you need to decide which one suits you better.
