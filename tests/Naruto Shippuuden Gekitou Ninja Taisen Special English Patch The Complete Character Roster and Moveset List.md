# How to Play Naruto Shippuuden Gekitou Ninja Taisen Special with English Patch
  
Naruto Shippuuden Gekitou Ninja Taisen Special is a fighting game based on the popular anime and manga series Naruto. It was released for the Nintendo Wii in Japan in 2010, but it never got an official English localization. However, thanks to some dedicated fans, you can now play this game with an English patch that translates most of the menus, texts, and dialogues.
  
In this article, we will show you how to play Naruto Shippuuden Gekitou Ninja Taisen Special with English patch on your PC using a Wii emulator called Dolphin. Dolphin is a free and open-source software that allows you to run Wii and GameCube games on your computer. You will also need a Wii ISO file of the game, which you can obtain from various sources online. Please note that downloading Wii ISO files may be illegal in some countries, so do it at your own risk.
